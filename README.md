## Author's Note
  I have worked very hard on this game and I am very proud of how it came out. I have instilled my own personality through it's designs and also left an unspoken story behind it. Unfortunately, after building and delivering this project, some visual
  and also very particular mechanical bugs made it in. The sad part is all of the individual scripts, Unity project and indivual designs were lost and now only the build remains. However, I think it is a complete experience that contours my road as a developer. Fair warning: The game is very hard.
